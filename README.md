# Sales_Analysis
In this Project, I have used Power BI and MS excel to analyze 3 years of sales data to design and deliver an end-to-end business intelligence solution. 
We have integrated multiple data sources about transactions, returns ,products, customers and territories and transformed raw data to create interactive visualization through data interpretation and analysis.
Motive of the project is to track KPIs( sales,revenue,profit, return), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends and forcast, 
and also identify high-value customers.
